## Requirements

ToastButton works on iOS 5.x+ version and is compatible with only ARC projects. It depends on the following Apple frameworks, which should already be included with most Xcode templates:

* Foundation.framework
* UIKit.framework
* CoreGraphics.framework
* QuartzCore.framework

You will need LLVM 3.0 or later in order to build ToastButton.
